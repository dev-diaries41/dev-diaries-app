# FPF Hub - productivity suite

## Overview 

One of the things I love about being a developer is that I can make software that meets my specific needs and maintain full control over it. Recently, I decided to upgrade my old personal notes mobile app, into what is a now a productivity suite: FPF Hub, loosely themed like GNOME Terminal and I've decided to share it with you. See the core features below as well as potential future ones.
